Oregami game database - CQRS version   [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/oregami/oregami-game-database-cqrs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/oregami/oregami-game-database-cqrs)

We want to create a new online-system for the management and the long time storage of computer- and videogame-data, which avoids the problems of other existing projects and is at the same time designed with innovation and sustainability.

These are the characteristics of our system:

- the logical data model will be comprehensive and therefore exceed the capabilities of any other existing game database.
- the underlying technology will be based upon a modern software architecture, so everything is easy expandable and maintainable.
- everybody (with the required skills) will be able to extend and enhance the source code
- the gathered data will be available to everybody, from a technical point of view as well as regarding licensing conditions
- multilingualism is a goal right from the beginning
- a nonprofit organisation (instead of one ore more individuals) will be the operator of the database, to assure a long term stability and availability.
